# Booth Data Task: Apology Order and Emotion

This repository contains an anonymous submission for the Behavioral Science and Marketing data analysis task.

The analysis examines how apology order and self-blame attribution relate to emotional responses in survey data, with a focus on emotional positivity across different apology scenarios.

## Research Question

Does who apologizes first affect emotional positivity, and does this effect differ depending on individuals’ self-blame tendencies?
